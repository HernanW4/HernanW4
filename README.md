# Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## About Me 
I'm Walter Hernandez, a **Software Engineer Developer** (specializing in **Cloud Engineering** and **Full-Stack Development**) pursuing my **Bachelors in Computer Science** and my masters in **Software Engineering**. 

I have always enjoyed new technologies and services that the **Computer Science** field has to offer. I have entangled in **Web Development**, **Embedded Systems** and must recently I have been exposed to the **DevOps Methodology and Cloud Engineering**. 

Up to this date, 2/14/2024, I have acquired both the beginner and intermediate level of multiple programming languages. Top choices languages being, **Python and Javascript**, **C/C++**, **Java** and currently learning **The Rust Programming Language**. 
I also have experience, and knowledge, with innovating tools and services such as **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**. Along experience with cloud services such as **AWS**, and **Google Cloud**. 

Although polishing my skills, learning new ones, is one of my hobbies. I do also enjoy other things. I'm a big fan of soccer, I don't play as muchm and enjoy going to the gym. And of course playing some video games here and there is always fun. 


# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
I have started the process to learn more about how does a graphics card is able to render various kind of arts, like pixels, on the screen. I seek to write a simple and small **Voxel Engine**. With that, I seek to learn the graphics api like 
OpenGL, then also learn essential and productive data manipulation. Concepts like multi-thread, are one of the many things I want to implement in this journey as well. This project will be done in **Rust** along with using a very effective graphics wrapper
known as **Wgpu**. I soon will have repository to keep track of my work. Wish me luck!
